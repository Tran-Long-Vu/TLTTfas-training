# Project: TLTT-facial-anti-spoof
## Training Facial Anti Spoof model on CVPR23 dataset.

Congifuration Environment

    python 3.11
    pytorch 2.2.1
    torchvision 0.17.1
    cuda 11.8

Run: "pip install -r requirements.txt"

## Pre-training




Its best to have the folders /model and /data ready before cloning the repository.

Download the CVPR23 Dataset.
Save samples in directory: $root/data/datasets/CVPR23/train/
The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% validation.

For mock training & models. Download models & training data on: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BSyfksbBj5dvB_0Q6e5pJiwyCjx_z68p?usp=drive_link

Git clone the repository.

Put the /data and /model folders in the correct order in the repository. Then cd to the repo.

## Training Data Directory:

Data directory: 

- data
    - datasets
        - CVPR23
            - Train
                - living
                    - subject
                        - imagename.jpg
                        - imagename.txt
                - spoof
                    - PAs type # printing attack type
                        - subject
                            - imagename.jpg
                            - imagename.txt

### Model Directory:

- model
  - scrfd.onnx
  - rn18-fas.onnx
  - mv3-fas.onnx
  - rn18-fas-ckp.pth
  
### To check if model & data configurations are ready:
- python3 checker.py


## Training

Cd to the folder $root of the repository, in separate terminal, run:

- mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080

Then run: 

- python3 train.py

The file /configs/config.py contains all the hyper-parameters used during training.

Saved checkpoints are in directory: /checkpoints/fas-best.ptl

Training metrics are recorded at: http://127.0.0.1:8080

To train from checkpoint change TRAIN_FROM_CHECKPOINT in configs.py to True.


## Testing with hand crawled data:

### Data directory: 
- data
    - datasets
        - Hand-crawl
            - videos
                - 0
                    - videoname.mp4
                - 1
                    - videoname.mp4
            - images
                - 0
                    - imagename.jpg
                - 1                
                    - imagename.jpg

### Run file:

python test.py

- Default test is printing attack.
- Test script is for .onnx model.
- Available test types: 'printing', 'replay', 'live'.
- Change INFERENCE_TYPE in configs.py to the correct type to test.
- To test checkpoint change TEST_FROM_CHECKPOINT in configs.py to True.

# Additional work to be added:
- log metrics on pyplot sklearn
